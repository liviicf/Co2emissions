# Co2emissions
We compared the countires with the top 10 CO2 emissions from 1970-2020 by using Pthyon. In so, we coded and manipulated data and built a box plot with swarm plot, a hisotgram and a time plot. After examinationm we found that out of the top 10 countrties with most Co2 emissons, China and the U.S. contributed the highest. The amount of emissions the 2 countries released dramatically increased the world average by all counties of CO2 emissions. 
Requirments: Python coding with descriptions and answer to questions by examination of Python coding
Data: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv, From "Our World in Data" is a collection of dataset updated regularly and includes data on CO2 emissions any other energy mix throughout decades of years and by countries across the globe.
Data Processing: After inputing the data, we removed observations and rows without corresponding countries and found colums wiht missing information. Then, found the top 10 countries with highest Co2 emissions and the year range in the data set. From there, we made a histogram, a boxplot wth a swarm plot, a time plot with all the countires adding the average Co2 emissions and a log scale .
